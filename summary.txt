##visual studio - its an IDE DEVELOPED my Microsoft used to develop websites,desktop applications etc

1. solution explorer- displays a solution and the project items created
2. Debug - allows you to inspect your code and finding errors.
3. git changes - here we can push code to github
4. Build - used to build the solution
5. Rebuild - used to rebuild the soln which is already build
6. 

#features:designer,debugger,code editor,extensiblity,

#ASP.NET - is a web Framework designed and developed my microsoft..
*it is built on CLR(Common Language Runtime)

Two major components:
#CLR - Common Language Run time
#Class Library

ADO.NET - Data Base support

WEB APPLICATIONS
#ASP.NET
#WF(Workflow)

Desktop Apps
#Winforms 
#WPF and silver light

compiled vs Interpreted language
compiled languages runs slowly if we do any mistakes wil get to knw der itself
interpreted languages are fast bt we wont get to knw errors untill we run it..(might get run time errors)

## ASP stands for active server pages and it is a server-side script engine for building web pages

##Data types in c# - 3 types 1.value data types 2.Refrence data types 3.pointer data types

console class - Console class provides some methods and properties using which we can implement the user interface in a console application.

#Variables in c#
1.static variable
2.Non-static
3.const variables-we cannot chnge its value once its declared
4.Read only variables - we cant change/modify (bt we can modify with in constructor)

##BOXING/UNBOXING
1.BOXING - Boxing means you basically set a value type to a reference type. 
2.UNBOXING - unboxing means you basically set a reference type to a value type.

##Type casting - converting one data type to another
2 types- 1.Implicit - converting lower to higher data type
         2.Explicit - converting higher to lower data type

EXAMPLE: int x=10;
         object y =x;//boxing
         int z= (int)y;//unboxing

##STATIC AND NON-STATIC
1.STATIC - members which are declared with a keyword are called static members
2.NON-STATIC - Which are not declared with any keyword.
     
##FUNCTIONS
1.Built-in-Functions
2.user defined

types of constructor
1.parameterized constructor
2.non parameterized constructor

*syntax for  creating constructor
public demo(){
   ------
}

##29/09/22
*have gone through class objects constructors
*practiced how to create a class and object 
*get set methods
*functions
*how to call a function
